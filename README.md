# This Repository has main code about the book of Big Data
## Content
##### 1. WordCount

- the easiest project
- aim: programming the project using small and easily understand knowledge 

##### 2. CarPrice_Predict

- the project which predicts the price of Cars
- use some models and some knowledge which is mentioned before

##### 3. Detect_Attack

- the project which detects the attacks online and streaming
- use some models in Apache and the structure mentioned before

##### 4. Happiness_Kmeans

- the project which use Kmeans algorithm to cluster Happiness
- use the Machine Learning Algorithm--Kmeans.
##### 5. HousePrice_Predict

- the project which predicts the price of House
- the same as project CarPrice_Predict, but the data clean and use have a little difference

##### 6. KnowledgeData_Analysis

- the project which analysis the knowledge data from some famous knowledge-sharing website
- some analysis models can be used

##### 7. LogisticRegression_NN

- the project which uses basic model--Logistic Regression
- NN is Neural Network, and is important NOW!!!
- use some knowledge which is mentioned before

##### 8. RideSharing_Evolution

- the project which parallels the algorithm
- the paralleled algorithm is important for accelerating algorithm
- use some knowledge which is mentioned before
